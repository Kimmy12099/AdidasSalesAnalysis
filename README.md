Worked with a small group to analyze U.S. Adidas sales, focusing on how regional differences impact profitability and sales performance. We examined sales data, consumer behavior, and market dynamics across various locations to identify areas of opportunity. Our analysis highlighted key strategies for Adidas to optimize profitability, including:

-Identifying Profitability Gaps: Pinpoint regions with underperforming sales and high operational costs to address inefficiencies.

-Maximizing Revenue from High-Performing Regions: Invest in regions with strong sales through targeted marketing, loyalty programs, and exclusive product launches to capitalize on existing demand.

-Enhancing the Product Portfolio: Tailor product offerings based on regional preferences, focusing on high-demand items and introducing innovative, sustainable products to attract diverse consumer segments.
